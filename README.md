"Week 6 Final Project: Creating the War card game" 

This program was made to recreate the War card game.
A deck of 52 cards is shuffled and split in half.
There are 2 players and each player is dealt a half of the deck. Each player draws a card at the same time and compare the two cards.
The player with the higher value card gains a point, if there is a tie there are no points awarded.
In this game, Ace will be low.

The game will continue until all cards have been played.
The HTML has a button to signal the start of the game and it the webpage will display the draws of each player and who won the point as output on the page.

At the end of the game, an alert box will pop up to signal the end of the game as well as state the winner of the game.
The scores of each player will also be displayed at the top of the screen.
